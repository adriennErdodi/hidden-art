      <h2>Think about that</h2>
      What is the meaning of graffiti?
      <br>Why do people do graffiti?
      <br>Is graffiti a crime?
      <br>Can you go to jail for doing graffiti?
      <p>These and other kind of similar questions could you meet if you are searching for the graffiti.
      <p>What do you think? Or on which side are you?
      <h2>A big question
      <br>Is this art or vandalism?</h2>
      Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations.
      <p>There are many different types and styles of graffiti, it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.
      <br>In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.
      <p>But it wasn'nt until the 5th century that the roots of the modern concept of vandalism were planted.
      At that time, a barbaric tribe known as the Vandals swept through Rome, pillaging and destroying the city.
      <p>But it wasn'nt until centuries later that the term vandalism was actually coined in an outcry against the defacing of art during the French Revolution.
      And as graffiti became increasingly associated with deliberate rebellion and provocativeness, it took on its vandalist label.
      <p>That's part of the reason why today many graffiti artists stay underground. Some assume alternate identities to avoid retribution, while others do so to establish comradery and make claim to territory.
        The questions of space and ownership is central to graffiti's history. Is's contemporary evolution has gone hand in hand with counterculture scenes.
        While these movements raised their anti-establishment voices, graffiti artists likewise challenged established boundaries of public property.
