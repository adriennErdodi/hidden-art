      <h2>A big question:
      <br>Is this art or vandalism?</h2>
      <p>Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations.</p>
      <p>There are many different types and styles of graffiti, it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.
        But it wasn'nt until the 5th century that the roots of the modern concept of vandalism were planted.
        Centuries later that the term vandalism was actually coined in an outcry against the defacing of art during the French Revolution.
        And as graffiti became increasingly associated with deliberate rebellion and provocativeness, it took on its vandalist label.</p>
      <p>That is part of the reason why today many graffiti artists stay underground. Some assume alternate identities to avoid retribution, while others do so to establish comradery and make claim to territory.
        The questions of space and ownership is central to graffiti's history. Is's contemporary evolution has gone hand in hand with counterculture scenes.
        While these movements raised their anti-establishment voices, graffiti artists likewise challenged established boundaries of public property.</p>
        <p><b>As the conterculture movements associated with graffiti become mainstream, does graffiti, too, become accepted?!</b></p>
        <p>Since the creation of so-called graffiti unions in the 1970s and the admission of select graffiti artists into art galleries a decade later, graffiti has straddled the line between being outside and inside the mainstream.
          <br>And the appropriation of graffiti styles by marketers and typographers has made this definitiob even more unclear.</p>
        <p>The once unlikely partnerships of graffiti artists with traditional museums and brands, have brought these artists out of the underground and into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Althought graffiti is linked to destruction, it's also a medium of unrestricted artistic expression.
          <br>Today, the debate about the boundary between defacing and beautifying continues.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, graffiti artists challenge common consensus about the value of art and the degree to which any space can be owned.</p>
        <p>Whether spraying, scrawling, or scratching, graffiti brings these questions of ownership, art and acceptability to the surface.</p>
