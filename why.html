      <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>In my case it was the last one years ago with my dog 'Chocolate' who became the newest family member.
        When time was flying he needed more and longer strolls. On one ocasion we were ramlbling in an outside area of the town.
        There were some weekend houses, some deserted buildings with a lot of garages.
      <p>Not just simple garages, but the most colorful ones what I have ever seen.
        Yes I have never seen graffiti before and they were beautiful.
        So I went back there in every week to see those wonderful paintings.
        And the most interesting part that they were also changing in every week when I could admire them.
        That was my first meet with 'Hidden Art'.
